GDPR Article 6 - Lawfulness of processing.
Processing is lawful only if at least one legal basis applies. These include consent, performance of a contract, compliance with a legal obligation, protection of vital interests, performance of a task carried out in the public interest or exercise of official authority, and legitimate interests pursued by the controller except where overridden by interests or rights of the data subject.
Controllers should document and communicate the legal basis used for each processing activity.
